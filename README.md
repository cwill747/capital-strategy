================

Capital Strategy is a board game-like video game in which you control a customizable army of warriors. You have control over an army of warriors and your goal is to defeat as many apposing nations as possible in order to establish dominance and a stronger army. At the conclusion of each ranked match, the winner has an agreed upon probability of acquiring a random warrior from the opponents army in exchange for a warrior of choice from the winner's army if the winner deem the random warrior a worthy trade. Nations can also acquire new warriors through completing quests such as achieving a number of wins, a number of consecutive wins, a win in less than X turns, etc. There may also be a single player mode where you can acquire warriors along the way.

Gameplay
----------------
Challenge a random opponent to a match to the death. The match consists of an open grid with the opponent's warriors on one side of the grid and yours on the other. You can select which warriors you want in your army and strategically arrange them on the grid before the match. Players alternate moves where on each move you can move/attack with one warrior. Each warrior has different levels of health, defense, strengths, weaknesses, movement, attack type, attack strength and recovery time. A warrior dies when it runs out of health and it is then promptly removed from the match/grid. The match ends when either player surrenders or every warrior in a player's army has died.
